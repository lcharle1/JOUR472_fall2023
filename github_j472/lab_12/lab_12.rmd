## You will need

-   tidytext and our usual libraries

## Load libraries and establish settings

**Task** Create a codeblock and load appropriate packages and settings for this lab.

```{r}
# Turn off scientific notation
options(scipen=999)

# Load the tidyverse.
library(tidytext)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(rvest)
```

## Questions

**Q1.** You've been assigned to report a story about the leading reasons that Maryland attorneys get sanctioned by the state for misconduct. The state [publishes lists of sanctions](https://www.courts.state.md.us/attygrievance/sanctions) that contain a short text description about the situation. Load the CSV file in the data folder containing records from fiscal year 2011 onwards. Make a list of unique words from the text column, then following the example in the pre_lab, remove common "stop words" from that list and create a list of the top 10 words containing the percentage of occurrences each word represents. What's the leading word in that answer and, broadly, what do you think the top 10 words describe?

```{r}
#Load the data
md_attorney_sanctions <- read_csv("data/md_attorney_sanctions.csv")



```

```{r}
#Create list of unique words


unique_words <- md_attorney_sanctions |> 
  select(text) |> 
  unnest_tokens (word, text)




#a_list_of_words <- c("Disbarred", "Commission Reprimand", "Suspension ", "Temporary suspension", "Indefinite Suspension", "Disbarment")

#unique(a_list_of_words)


#View(unique_words)

```

```{r}
#Load stop words

data("stop_words")

stop_words <- stop_words |>
  add_row(word = "failing") |> 
  add_row(word = "attorney") |>
  add_row(word = "client") |> 
  add_row(word = "respondent") 

```

```{r}
#Remove stop words from unique words list

unique_words_no_stop_words <- unique_words |>
  anti_join(stop_words)

unique_words_no_stop_words |>
  anti_join(stop_words) |>
  group_by(word) |>
  tally(sort=TRUE) |>
  mutate(percent = (n/sum(n))*100) |>
  top_n(50)

```

**A1.** The top 10 words fit what you would hear in a court or by a lawyer/attorney. Given the context of these being reprimands, it shows the most common crimes probably have to do with funds and the clients. After removing the top repetitive stop words, we can see trust is at the top, not failing, and engaging and reprimand is added. With more context these words would make sense but still knowing the overall context, it kind of makes sense.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Q2.** Let's move beyond single words to phrases. Make a list of the top 10 three-word phrases, called trigrams, based on the example from the pre_lab (you'll need to modify the example code to do this). What's the top trigram and how often does it appear? What does that phrase mean in legal terms?

```{r}
# Check the task 12 on Pre-lab 12 to see if you can use that code


md_attorney_sanctions |>
  unnest_tokens(trigram, text, token = "ngrams", n = 3) |>
  separate(trigram, c("word1", "word2", "word3"), sep = " ") |>
  filter(!word1 %in% stop_words$word) |>
  filter(!word2 %in% stop_words$word) |>
  filter(!word3 %in% stop_words$word) |>
  mutate(trigram = paste(word1, word2, word3, sep=" ")) |>
  group_by(trigram) |>
  tally(sort=TRUE) |>
  mutate(percent = (n/sum(n))*100) |>
  top_n(10)

```

**A2.** The top trigram is conducting involving dishonesty. In legal terms, this is a violation of conduct where the attorney was dishonest.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Q3.** Let's drop back down to more traditional text analysis - take the top trigram from Q2 and write code to see how many times it occurs in the text column in each fiscal year. What do you think the answer produced by your code suggests? What else could you do to try and clarify the most important reasons attorneys get sanctioned?

```{r}

md_attorney_sanctions |>
  filter(str_detect (text, 'collecting unreasonable fees'))|>
  group_by(fiscal_year)|>
  tally(sort = TRUE)
```

**A3.** The fiscal year which mentions the term "attorney trust account" the most in its sanctions is 2021, with the term appearing 37 times and accounting for 19.577% of all times the term was said in the sanctions since 2011. This leads me to believe that many people had funds in their attorney trust accounts in 2021 as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, and one of the most common infractions for lawyers to commit is stealing escrow funds from their clients' accounts. So it is possible that many lawyers in practice were stealing funds and exploiting those who were disadvantaged (particularly families and businesses) during the pandemic.

**my answer:** with 'collecting unreasonable fees', there was a rise in 2020 and 2021 for attorneys being reprimanded for collecting unreasonable fees. I think including more ngrams to add alittle more context would help with clarifying.
